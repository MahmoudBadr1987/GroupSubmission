  <h4> Hello,my name is <b>Mahmoud Eltoukhy</b>. <br>
    I'm  student in Centennial college. I've enrolled in "Software Engineering Technology and Artificial Intelligence" program. 
    I am a registered pharmacist in Canada, but I decided to change my career. I live 
    in Quebec, so I can speak a little bit French, beside English and ,my mother language, Arabic. I'm a father of two little girls Talia nd Alice.
    I believe that the AI is interesting and require a significant amount of logic
     and that's why I chose to study this domain.
